# Agent Notes — skills-registry

This file is a living guide for AI agents and new contributors. It captures the architecture, patterns, and trade-offs of the current (0.5.x) **GitHub-backed registry** design. The PyPI package is `skills-registry`; the GitHub repo is still named `skills-mcp` (org URL unchanged); the Python module path is still `skills_mcp` (renaming would be a churn-without-payoff refactor).

> **What changed in 0.3.0:** The project pivoted from "consolidate local skills" (gather/add) to "personal GitHub registry repo, fetched on demand". `gather` and `add` were removed. A new Go CLI handles all interactive UX, and a separate Python MCP server exposes the registry as three tools.

---

## Project Overview

`skills-registry` is now three coordinated deliverables shipped from a single repo:

| Piece | Language | Distribution | Job |
|---|---|---|---|
| `skills-registry` (Python) | Python 3.10+ | PyPI (`pip install skills-registry` / `uvx`) | Thin bootstrap (`skills-registry init`) only. |
| `skill-registry-mcp` (Python) | Python 3.10+ | Same wheel, second `[project.scripts]` entry point | FastMCP server with 3 tools (`list_skills`, `get_skill`, `publish_skill`). |
| `skill-registry` (Go) | Go 1.24+ | GitHub Releases tarballs (built by `.github/workflows/release.yml`) | Charmbracelet TUI: `bootstrap`, `list`, `get`, `sync`, `add`, `publish`. |

- **Build (Python):** `hatchling` + `hatch-vcs` (PEP 517; version from `vX.Y.Z` tags)
- **Package manager (Python):** `uv`
- **Test runner (Python):** `pytest` with `pytest-cov`
- **Lint/Format (Python):** `ruff`
- **Build/Test (Go):** stdlib (`go build`, `go test`, `go vet`)
- **TUI library:** Charmbracelet (bubbletea + lipgloss + bubbles + cobra)
- **MCP transport:** stdio via FastMCP 3.x
- **Network surface:** Everything talks to GitHub through `gh api` subprocess calls. **No direct HTTP, no `git` binary, no SSH.**

## Architecture

### Three deliverables, one repo

```
[user] → uvx skills-registry init (Python)
            ├─ ensure_authed(gh)
            ├─ gh release download skill-registry (Go binary → ~/.local/bin)
            └─ os.execv → `skill-registry bootstrap`
                            ├─ scan dot-folders (Go)
                            ├─ prompt name/visibility (Bubble Tea)
                            ├─ gh repo create
                            ├─ Git-Data-API push (blobs → tree → commit → ref)
                            ├─ multi-select agent install targets
                            ├─ write skill-registry/SKILL.md to each
                            └─ print MCP JSON snippet
```

Persisting `skill-registry-mcp` for desktop MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code/Copilot) is the user's responsibility — `uv tool install skills-registry` (documented in the README) installs both console-script entry points (`skills-registry` and `skill-registry-mcp`) so clients can launch the registry server without depending on the `uvx` cache. `cmd_init` does **not** run this step itself.

### Why a separate Go binary?

The user-facing `building-glamorous-tuis` skill recommends Charmbracelet (Go). Charmbracelet has no first-class Python equivalent. Building the bootstrap UX in Bubble Tea required a Go binary regardless, so `skills-registry init` was reduced to **a thin Python shim that downloads-then-execs**. This keeps the polished TUI logic in one place and lets the MCP server stay in Python (where FastMCP lives).

### Why no `git`, no SSH, no HTTP client?

Desktop MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code/Copilot) spawn the MCP server with a stripped environment:
- `PATH` doesn't include your shell extensions.
- `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is unset.
- `git config user.email` may be missing.

To stay robust in those conditions, **every write goes through the GitHub Git Data API**, called via `gh api` (which we've already verified is authed). The sequence is identical in Python (`registry_api.RegistryClient.publish_skill`) and Go (`registry.Client.Publish`):

```
GET  /repos/{r}/git/ref/heads/{branch}        → parent SHA
GET  /repos/{r}/git/commits/{parent}          → base tree SHA
GET  /repos/{r}/git/trees/{base}?recursive=1  → list stale files under <slug>/
POST /repos/{r}/git/blobs                     → upload each file
POST /repos/{r}/git/trees                     → new tree referencing base + blobs (+ null SHAs for deletions)
POST /repos/{r}/git/commits                   → commit pointing at new tree, parents=[parent]
PATCH /repos/{r}/git/refs/heads/{branch}      → fast-forward ref
```

Conflicts (409/422) trigger up to 3 retries with exponential backoff against the freshly-fetched HEAD.

### Caching

`get_skill` writes to `~/.cache/skills-mcp/skills/<slug>/` with a sibling `<slug>.meta.json` storing the **registry tree SHA** at fetch time. The next call:
1. Asks the registry for the current `<slug>/` tree SHA.
2. Returns the cached path immediately if the SHA matches.
3. Otherwise wipes the folder and re-downloads.

Force-pushes and any subtree change correctly invalidate.

### Single source of truth for agent dot-folders

`cli/internal/agents/agents.go` holds the canonical 56-entry list of known AI tool dot-folders, each annotated with a display name and a `Universal`/`UnderHome` flag. The Python side doesn't need this list any more (the legacy `gather` command was the only consumer); for the new flow it's Go-only.

## Key Symbols

| Symbol | File | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `RegistryClient` | `src/skills_mcp/registry_api.py` | Python: `list_skills` / `download_skill` / `publish_skill`. Owns Git Data API logic + retry. |
| `registry.Client` | `cli/internal/registry/registry.go` | Go mirror of `RegistryClient`. Same endpoints, same order, same retries. |
| `build_server()` | `src/skills_mcp/registry_server.py` | Constructs the FastMCP server. Validates auth + config at boot. |
| `cmd_init` | `src/skills_mcp/init.py` | Thin bootstrap; `os.execv` into Go binary; no TUI. |
| `runBootstrap` | `cli/cmd/skill-registry/bootstrap.go` | Owns the interactive flow (TUI prompts + repo create + agent multi-select). |
| `find_gh` / `FindGH` | `src/skills_mcp/gh.py`, `cli/internal/registry/registry.go` | PATH + fallback lookup (`~/.local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`). |
| `MultiSelectModel` | `cli/internal/tui/multiselect.go` | Fuzzy-searchable multi-select with locked-universal section. |
| `parse_frontmatter` / `first_paragraph` | `src/skills_mcp/frontmatter.py` | Tiny YAML-ish frontmatter parser + description fallback used by `registry_api`. |
| `scan.Discover` | `cli/internal/scan/scan.go` | Local skill discovery + frontmatter parsing. Used by `sync`, `add`, `bootstrap`. |

---

## Testing

- **Python:** focused suite covering `cache`, `config`, `frontmatter`, `gh`, `init`, `registry_api`, `registry_server`, and `skill_md`. The `registry_api` suite stubs `gh` with a Python shim that replays scripted JSON responses based on argv substring matches.
- **Go:** Tests for `agents`, `bootstrap`, `config`, `scan`, and `registry` (also uses a `gh` shim invoked via `/bin/sh` → `python3`). Run with `cd cli && go test ./...`.
- Run everything:
  ```bash
  uv run pytest -v --cov=skills_mcp --cov-report=term-missing
  (cd cli && go vet ./... && go test ./...)
  ```

## Known Issues & Improvement Opportunities

### Outstanding

1. **No `remove`/`update` commands.** `Publish` already handles deletions via stale-file detection, but there's no user-facing way to drop a skill from the registry. Easy follow-up.
2. **No multi-registry support.** Config is one-repo. Adding a `[registries]` array + a `connect <owner/repo>` CLI command would let an agent see several registries side-by-side.
3. **Browsing third-party public registries** is not yet a first-class flow. The read tools (`list_skills`, `get_skill`) don't require write access — wiring them to an arbitrary `owner/repo` would be a few lines.
4. **Windows MCP-server-side init path** is best-effort. The Go binary builds for Windows, but `skills-registry init`'s `gh release download` + `chmod` assumes POSIX. PowerShell helpers + `gh.exe` lookup would close this gap.
5. **Skill MD template duplicated** between Python (`skill_md.py`) and Go (`bootstrap/skillmd.go`). They must stay in sync; future template changes should land in both places (and there's no test today that enforces parity).
6. **`build_server()` does no schema validation** of the SKILL.md it serves. A malformed skill makes `list_skills` skip it silently; a verbose-mode error log would help debugging.

### Carried over from the previous design

- **Frontmatter parser is YAML-ish.** Both Python and Go avoid a real YAML dep; multi-line values, lists, and nested keys are silently dropped. Fine for the current scope.

---

## CI / CD

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — runs the Python job (ruff lint + format + pytest with coverage) **and** the Go job (vet + build + test) in parallel on every push/PR. Both must be green to merge.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — **auto-releases on every push to `main` that touches `src/`, `cli/`, `tests/`, or `pyproject.toml`**. The path filter is the release decision; commits that only touch docs, workflow files, or other non-source paths do not release.
  1. Tests gate (ruff + pytest + go vet + go test) — must pass.
  2. Tag job computes the next semver from the latest `vX.Y.Z` tag, then pushes a lightweight tag on the triggering commit. CI never commits version bumps back to `main`.
  3. Python package version is dynamic via `hatch-vcs`; building from the release tag produces the matching wheel/sdist version.
  4. Builds the Python wheel + sdist (`uv build`) and the Go CLI for `darwin/amd64`, `darwin/arm64`, `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `windows/amd64`.
  5. Creates a single GitHub Release `vX.Y.Z` containing all 7 assets (wheel, sdist, 4 Go tarballs, 1 Go zip). `skills-registry init` downloads the Go binary from this same "latest" release.
  6. Publishes the wheel to PyPI via the `pypi` environment using `PYPI_API_TOKEN`.
- Force a non-patch bump with `gh workflow run release.yml -f bump=minor` (or `major`).
- **Gaps:** No Python version matrix yet, no OS matrix for the Python tests, no Dependabot, no codecov upload (coverage XML is generated but not uploaded), no integration tests that actually call GitHub. The test gate inside `release.yml` is a near-duplicate of `ci.yml`; if you change one, check the other.

## Security Notes

- **No `git` shell-out, no SSH agent dependency, no embedded HTTP client.** All GitHub I/O routes through the user's authenticated `gh` CLI.
- `subprocess.run()` is used with list args (no `shell=True`).
- `RegistryClient.publish_skill` rejects paths containing `..` segments and skips dotfiles (`.git`, `.DS_Store`, …) and `__pycache__`.
- `_normalize_rel_path` rejects backslash-encoded traversals and absolute-path injection.
- A per-file size cap (`SKILLS_MAX_FILE_BYTES`, default 2 MiB) prevents accidental upload of huge binaries.
- The Go binary uses identical validation paths.

## How to Work on This Repo

```bash
# Setup
uv sync --group dev
(cd cli && go mod download)

# Run all tests (Python + Go)
uv run pytest -v --cov=skills_mcp --cov-report=term-missing
(cd cli && go vet ./... && go test ./...)

# Lint & format Python
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .

# Install pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install

# Smoke-test the Go binary locally
(cd cli && go build -o /tmp/skill-registry ./cmd/skill-registry && /tmp/skill-registry --help)
```

When making changes:
- **FastMCP server conventions.** Construct servers with `FastMCP(name, instructions=..., version=__version__)`. Register every tool through `@server.tool(...)` and pass an `annotations={...}` dict carrying the safety hints that matter for client gating — `readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint` / `openWorldHint`. Use `Args:` docstring sections only when per-parameter descriptions add real value (e.g. mutually-exclusive params); single-arg tools don't need them. Don't pass `title` or `idempotentHint` unless you have a concrete consumer.
- **Keep Python and Go in sync.** If you change the registry contract (`registry_api.py` ↔ `registry.go`), update both implementations and both test suites in the same PR. Same for the `skill-registry/SKILL.md` template.
- Do not add new mandatory runtime dependencies without justification. The Python side has exactly one (`fastmcp`); the Go side has cobra + bubbletea/bubbles/lipgloss + yaml.v3.
- Update `README.md` and `docs/registry.md` if you change anything user-visible.
- Add or update tests for any behavior change. Untested behavior is treated as undefined.
- Use conventional-commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`).
- **GUI environment safety:** any new code that talks to GitHub MUST go through `gh api` (or `gh release download` / `gh repo create`). Never assume `git`, `ssh`, or `user.name`/`user.email` are configured.
